The GBA can handle up to 128 sprites
Sprites must be stored in OAM (object attribute memory) to be rendered
OAM has just enough room to store 128 sets of 4 16-bit values. (16*4*128)/8 = 1 KB
Each one is made up of 4 16-bit attributes that pack all kinds of data into their bits

Attribute 0
	bits 0-7	y coordinate
	bits 8,9	affine
		used for specifying affine transformations
	bits 10,11	effect
		toggles between alpha-blending and masking
	bit 12		mosaic
		toggles the "mosaic effect"
	bit 13		color mode
		0 = 16-color
		1 = 256-color
	bits 14,15	shape
		see below
Attribute 1
	bits 0-7	x coordinate
	bits 9-11	unused
	bit 12		h-flip
		flips the sprite horizontally
	bit 13		v-flip
		flips the sprite vertically
	bits 14,15	size
Attribute 2
	bits 0-9	tile index
		the index of the first tile in the sprite.
	bits 10,11	priority
		used for layering. low appears over high. sprites appear over backgrounds of the same priority
	bits 12-15	palette bank
		only used for 16-bit color sprites
Attribute 3
	used internally by the gba to handle affine transformations
======================================================================================================

The dimensions of the sprite are determined by the size and shape properties, as per this table:
			Size
			0		1		2		3
Shape	0	8x8		16x16	32x32	64x64
		1	16x8	32x8	32x16	64x32
		2	8x16	8x32	16x32	32x64
