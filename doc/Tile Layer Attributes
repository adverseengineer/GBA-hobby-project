The GBA can handle 4 tile layers and one sprite layer. For more info on sprites, look at 'Sprite Attributes'
For each background layer, there is a register to control the behaviour and properies of that layer. The value in the register packs several values into it's bits

bits 0,1	priority
	used for layering. low appears over high. sprites appear over backgrounds of the same priority
bits 2,3	character
	the index of the character block the image data for this background is stored in
bits 4,5	unused
bit 6		mosaic
	toggles mosaic effect for this background
bit 7		color mode
	0 = 16-color
	1 = 256-color
bits 8-12	screen
	the index of the screen block that stores the tile map data for this background
bit 13		wrap
	toggles whether the background wraps at the edges
bits 14,15	size
	the dimensions of the background

0					32x32							16x16
1					64x32							32x32
2					32x64							64x64
