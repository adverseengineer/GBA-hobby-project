This is a hobby project that I'm using to brush up on C. Any constructive criticism is welcome because I have no idea what I'm doing.

Conventions I'm using:
Left curly braces belong at the end of the line preceding them  
Omit curly braces that only enclose one line  
Short-circuit all `if` statements  
Any function with zero parameters must have `void` in its parameter list  
Functions must be `inline`'d whenever beneficial  
All `#define`'s must be in all caps  
Mark any function parameter that is not intended to change with `const`  
Mark any data that belongs in ROM with `const`
